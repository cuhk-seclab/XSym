# README for bdf2gdfont

This perl script is for converting X11 bdf font files into GD font format
file for PHP3.  The original script was written by Stig S. Bakken
<ssb@fast.no>.  I have fixed a minor bug in it and added more options,
plus this README file.

Note that since PHP now has support for TTF fonts through the FreeType
library, you will get much nicer results with that.

This script has several limitations.

	. it may not work with all bdf files as it assumed certain things
	that is not BDF compliant.

	. the GD font format is limited to 256 character encoding, but BDF
	can handle two bytes (up to 65535 encodings).  currently this script
	silently ignores encoding higher than 255.

Options:

-d n	Turn debugging on, where n is how verbose, higher number is more
	verbose.

-b	The default is to convert fonts align along a common baseline from
	the top.  This flag make the common baseline from the bottom.

Example usage.

$ bdf2gdfont helvO10.bdf >helvO10.gd

file gif.php3
-------------
<?
        Header("Content-type: image/gif");
        $im = imagecreatefromgif("/tmp/out.gif");
        ImageGif($im);
        ImageDestroy($im);
?>

file demo.php3
--------------
<?
	$fnt = ImageLoadFont("/tmp/helvO10.gd");
	$im = ImageCreate(500, 90);
	$black = ImageColorAllocate($im, 255, 255, 255);
	$y = 0;
	$str = "";
	for ($i=32; $i<128; $i++) {
		$str .= chr($i) . " ";
		if (($i % 24) == 0) {
			ImageString($im, $fnt, 0, $y, $str, $black);
			$y += 15;
			$str = "";
		}
	}
	ImageString($im, $fnt, 0, $y, $str, $black);
	ImageGif($im, "/tmp/out.gif");
	ImageDestroy($im);
?>
