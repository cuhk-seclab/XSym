I am currently working to make the C code a part of the standard php 
distribution; however, at this time it takes some manual configuration.

Also, the following steps only really aply to unix versions of php,
it should be possible to compile on NT, but this install sequence does
not cover that instance.

I apologize for the lack of automated configuration.  This will updated
shortly.  This has only been tested with php-3.0.4 and php-3.0.6
on a linux-glibc 2.0.36 system with MCK-3.2.0.3.

There is no longer any need to modify your php as of php-cvs 01/26/99,
simply ./configure --with-mck=/your/mck/dir

To use the scripts:
A test.php3 is included with this distribution, it is fairly self explanatory to the php user.
