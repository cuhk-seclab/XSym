	This file needs to be compiled in with php on windows so that the
	oracle dll will work (and can be compiled).  preferably, I would
	like to see if there is another way accomplish what needs to be
	done with the symbol_table in ora_set_param_values() in oracle.c.
	This is just a quick hack to get this out.
