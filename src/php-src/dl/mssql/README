PHP3 Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 extention

What is it?

This is an extension library which enables support for
Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 in PHP3 under Windows NT.
Actually it is a copy of the Sybase library, patched to work with
Microsofts drivers.
At the moment the library might be a bit unstable when
working with simultan connections. Please feel free to add or modify
the code, or drop me an email (fmk@businessnet.dk)

Installation

First, you need to fetch the library files from 

 http://www.php.net/extra/mssql_lib.zip

Then you need to install MS SQL Client (or the complete SQL server)
Open and compile the project mssql.dsp with MS VC++ 5.0
Copy mssql.dll to c:\php3

How to call it from PHP3

Sample:
<?

dl("mssql.dll");

$Conn = mssql_connect("MySQL", "User", "Password");
$RS = mssql_query("SELECT * FROM UserTable", $Conn);

while ($Record = mssql_fetch_row($RS)) {
	while (list($key, $value) = each($Record)
		print("\$key = $key, \$value = $value\n");
}
mssql_free_result($RS);
mssql_close($Conn);

?>
