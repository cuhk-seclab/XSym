This has been heavily hacked up from what was released to comp.sources.misc,
volume43 by Jim Winstead <jimw@php.net> for use in PHP 3.0.

The original source can be found at any decent comp.sources.misc archive.

DBF

by Brad Eacker
Music, Intuition, Software, and Computers (MISC)

DBF is a set of tools and library routines to manipulate xbase files.

        dbflst [-vdhr] <file>

is used to list all the records in the file out to the stdout

        dbfget [-vhr] <file> [<record> <record>...]

lists to stdout the specified records

        dbfadd <file> <field> <field> ...

used to add a record to the end of a .dbf file

        dbfdel <file> [<record> <record> ...]

allows you to mark as deleted a record in a .dbf file

        dbfpack <file>

removes deleted records from the specified .dbf file

	tmpl

builds the tmpl.dbf.  This .dbf file is the prototype for all other database
creations.

	dbfcreat [-v] <file> <target xbase>

is used to create a database from a properly structured database that
uses the field structure defined in tmpl.dbf

	dbfcr <filename> f_name f_type f_len f_fdc [f_name ... f_fdc] ...

is a shell script that will create a database from a specified list of
field parameters.  It uses dbfcreat to do the actual build and will put
together the prototype template from the command args.

	dbfscan <dbf file> <ndx file>

allows you to list the dbf file using the order of the records in the
index.

This package also includes a basic grammar recognizer for xbase .prg files.

As an added bonus I have put together a minimum SQL recognizer as spec'ed
in Microsoft's "ODBC 2.0 Programmer's Reference and SDK Guide".

To build this package, make should be able to build it just fine.  It has
been built on a couple of machine types.  Though you may need to take a
look at the defines at the top of the makefile to see if you need to
modify it to build in your environment.
